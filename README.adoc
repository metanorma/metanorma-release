= Metanorma Release repository

WARNING: This repository is for INTERNAL USE ONLY.

Today Metanorma spans over 50 gems. Changes to underlying gems, such as https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma[`metanorma`] can cause many of the downstream gems to need upgrading.

We use the https://github.com/metanorma/lapidist[`lapidist`] gem to synchronize the releases.


== Resources

This repo https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-release[`metanorma-release`] is used as the main building environment.

It submodules *all* metanorma gems for the release process, and also maintains a gem dependency tree within metanorma (should be easy to automate, or worse to worse manual...).


== Flow

This is really a "`composite-git-flow`" kind of process. Maybe it's called `git gush` or `git cascade`.

The typical scenario is:

. A flavor gem needs enhancing (e.g. ISO)
. `metanorma-iso` forces change on a basic gem, like `isodoc`
. An `isodoc` update means the testing on all downstream gems needs to be updated

This is how the Metanorma release flow will look like.

=== Updating code and integrated testing

. Go to this `metanorma-release` repository

. Run a script to create feature branches in all gems.

. Do the necessary work in the submodule'd (in this repo) `isodoc` and `metanorma-iso`

. Run a script that performs tests on all the gems at once using the newly created feature branches

.. (alt) if you want Travis to test for you, push the `metanorma-release` repository, and Travis will build for you

. When all the gems pass, run a script to make PRs to every repository. If the feature branch for a gem is empty, the script will ignore it.

. Merge PRs by hand or by script (into master or a release branch)


=== Releasing

. When a release branch is ready (for all gems), run a script to:
.. Bump version of those gems (`VERSION` variable in code)
.. Update the ``Gemfile``s (remove feature branches)
.. Update ``gemspec``s to lock versions

. Issue PRs for those gems to merge their release branches into `master`.

. Merge the release PRs by hand or by script.

Ideally, we want to update the base gems first, then the immediately dependent gems, and so forth to ensure that the builds always pass.
